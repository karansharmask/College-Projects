    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        The predecessor of the firecracker was a type of heated bamboo, used as early as 200 BC, that exploded 
        when heated continuously. The Chinese name for firecrackers, baozhu, literally means "exploding bamboo."
        [2] After the invention of gunpowder, gunpowder firecrackers had a shape that resembled bamboo and produced
         a similar sound, so the name "exploding bamboo" was retained.[3] In traditional Chinese culture,
         firecrackers were used to scare off evil spirits.

        substance, is pressure. The entire firecracker must be very tightly packed in order for it to work best.
        Flash powder, however, does not need to be packed tightly, and should not be
